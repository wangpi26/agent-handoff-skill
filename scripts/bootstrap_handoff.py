> This file is the durable memory for agents working in this repository.
> A new agent should be able to read this file, inspect only the files needed for the current task, and continue without relying on previous chat history.

## Maintenance Contract

- Read this file before planning or editing.
- Update this file whenever task state, decisions, touched files, validation results, blockers, risks, or next actions change.
- Keep it factual and compact. Prefer file paths, commands, and concrete outcomes.
- Do not include secrets, credentials, long command logs, large code blocks, or chat transcript dumps.
- Replace stale notes instead of accumulating contradictory history.
- Mark uncertainty as `UNKNOWN` and resolve it from repository evidence when needed.

## Handoff Snapshot

- Last updated: {today}
- Last agent: Codex/Claude Code
- Workspace root: `{root}`
- Current objective: Establish durable Agent handoff mechanism for this repository.
- Current status: initialized
- Immediate next actions:
  - Inspect repository-specific files and replace `UNKNOWN` entries with verified facts.
- Active files:
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Blockers: none
- Open questions:
  - Confirm whether handoff files should be committed or remain local-only.

## Workspace Map

- `.`: repository root.
- Main entry points:
  - `UNKNOWN`
- Test entry points:
  - `UNKNOWN`
- Docs/specs:
  - `UNKNOWN`

## Durable Project Context

- UNKNOWN: Populate with long-lived project facts verified from repository files or user input.

## Operating Rules For Future Agents

- Start each session by relying on preloaded project rules if present, then reading this file explicitly.
- Use this file as continuity memory, not as a replacement for reading source code.
- Verify behavior from source files before changing implementation.
- Keep edits scoped to the current task and existing project conventions.
- Do not modify generated dependency folders or unrelated files unless explicitly asked.
- Never revert unrelated user or agent changes.
- Before final response, update this file with status, changed files, validation, risks, and next steps.

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Reason | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {today} | Use `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` as repository-local durable agent memory. | Preserve continuity across sessions and agents. | User request or bootstrap action. |

## Current Work Log

### {today}

- Objective: Establish durable Agent handoff mechanism.
- Changed files:
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`: Created initial durable handoff state.
  - `AGENTS.md`: Created or updated Codex project-level handoff rules if enabled.
  - `.claude/CLAUDE.md`: Created or updated Claude Code project-level handoff rules if enabled.
- Result: Initial handoff mechanism scaffolded.
- Remaining risks: Repository-specific context still contains `UNKNOWN` until source files are inspected.

## Task Backlog

- [ ] Replace `UNKNOWN` entries with verified repository facts.
- [ ] Confirm whether handoff files should be committed or gitignored.

## Validation History

| Date | Command/Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {today} | Bootstrap file creation | passed | Generated initial handoff scaffold; repository-specific facts still need review. |

## Handoff Update Template

Use this when ending a task or when the session may be interrupted:

> Read this file first, then follow the Recovery Reading Order below.

## Maintenance Contract

- Keep this file short. It is an index and recovery route, not a work log.
- Store current task state in `.agent-handoff/snapshot.md`.
- Store durable facts, decisions, validation, backlog, risks, and archives in the dedicated files listed below.
- Keep all content factual and repository-based. Mark uncertainty as `UNKNOWN`.
- Do not include secrets, credentials, long logs, full code blocks, or chat transcript dumps.
- Before final response for any non-trivial task, update the relevant `.agent-handoff/` files.

## Handoff Layout

- `.agent-handoff/snapshot.md`: Current objective, status, next actions, active files, blockers, and open questions.
- `.agent-handoff/workspace.md`: Repository map, entry points, test commands, docs, and stable project context.
- `.agent-handoff/decisions.md`: Important decisions with reasons and evidence.
- `.agent-handoff/work-log.md`: Recent operational work log.
- `.agent-handoff/validation.md`: Validation commands/checks, results, and caveats.
- `.agent-handoff/backlog.md`: Pending work and follow-ups.
- `.agent-handoff/risks.md`: Risks, blockers, unknowns, and user/source confirmations needed.
- `.agent-handoff/archive.md`: Compressed old history that is not part of normal startup.

## Recovery Reading Order

1. Read this file.
2. Read `.agent-handoff/snapshot.md`.
3. Read `.agent-handoff/risks.md`.
4. Read `.agent-handoff/backlog.md`.
5. Read `.agent-handoff/validation.md` only if validation state matters for the current task.
6. Read `.agent-handoff/decisions.md` only when changing architecture, behavior, dependencies, or prior decisions.
7. Read `.agent-handoff/workspace.md` only when orientation, commands, entry points, or subproject boundaries are needed.
8. Read `.agent-handoff/work-log.md` only when recent implementation details are needed.
9. Read `.agent-handoff/archive.md` only when explicitly needed for old context.

## Project Rule Targets

- Claude Code project rules: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`

## Closeout Rule

For non-trivial work, update the relevant files before final response:

- Always update `.agent-handoff/snapshot.md`.
- Update `.agent-handoff/work-log.md` when files or task status changed.
- Update `.agent-handoff/validation.md` when checks were run or intentionally skipped.
- Update `.agent-handoff/decisions.md` when a durable decision was made.
- Update `.agent-handoff/backlog.md` and `.agent-handoff/risks.md` when follow-ups, blockers, risks, or unknowns changed.

    return f"""## Required Startup Routine

{startup}

## Default Implementation Standard

For non-trivial development work, target production/commercial-grade quality by default rather than minimum viable implementation. Prefer robust, maintainable solutions with appropriate validation, runtime and edge-case consideration, and clear reporting of what was and was not tested. Keep scope aligned with the user's request; do not add unrelated features or speculative abstractions.

## Stable File Reading Protocol

To avoid stale snippets, line-number drift, or large unnecessary reads:

1. Prefer dedicated search/read tools for ordinary file lookup, content search, and file reads.
2. Confirm file size before reading large or volatile files, using line counts or targeted searches when needed.
3. Search for exact targets first, then read small exact ranges around those targets.
4. Keep read ranges small unless the file is known to be short.
5. If a read method becomes unreliable, use shell verification commands such as `wc -l`, `rg -n`, and small-range reads with quoted paths.
6. Do not propose or edit code based on uncertain offsets; re-anchor with search results first.

## Continuation Recovery Guard

If the user says `continue`, `继续`, `Continue from where you left off.`, or any equivalent continuation request, treat it as an explicit instruction to resume the task. Do not answer `No response requested.` and do not stop silently. First state the last known objective and next concrete action, then continue. If context is insufficient, recover from the handoff files and task-relevant source files before acting.

## Durable Handoff Memory

{memory}

## Handoff Size Discipline

{size}

## Mandatory Closeout Protocol

{closeout}

## Work Discipline

- Do not assume which subproject is active. Infer it from the user request, handoff files, and repository evidence.
- Prefer existing project conventions over new abstractions.
- Read files before editing them.
- Keep edits scoped to the task.
- Do not modify generated dependency folders unless explicitly asked.
- Never revert unrelated user or agent changes.
- Record validation honestly. If tests or checks were not run, say so in handoff files and in the final response.

Confirm project rules are loaded, then read AGENT_HANDOFF.md and follow its Recovery Reading Order. At minimum read .agent-handoff/snapshot.md, .agent-handoff/risks.md, and .agent-handoff/backlog.md before planning.

Recover the current objective, status, immediate next action, active files, blockers, validation caveats, and source files that need inspection. Read only task-relevant files after that.
